## 🧠 How It Works (RAG Architecture)

9anonAI uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, meaning:

1. **Legal documents** (laws, regulations, case references, policies) are indexed
2. Relevant sources are **retrieved in real time**

This allows the chatbot to:
- Cite legal reasoning
- Explain *why* an answer is correct
- Adapt to jurisdictional context (when configured)
